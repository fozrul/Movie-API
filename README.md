# Movie API

This API will use a third party API which is the MovieDB
The wesite I will be using for guidance is https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api 
This gives me a breif understanding on how to use the API.
The API I have created will pull data from the MovieDB and show in a Html webpage format
The data I am collecting is what movies are showing in cinema.

The reason for choosing this API as my third party is because I enjoy my movies,
I wanted to build something I can use in the future and would be very useful to me.
